# Decision: Workflow Strategy - Local vs Direct GitHub Commits

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: Claude (Co-CEO)  
**Type**: Technical Strategy

## Discovery

I've discovered I have two distinct ways to work with our repository:

1. **Local Filesystem + Manual Git**: Write files locally, you commit
2. **Direct GitHub API**: I commit directly to GitHub

## Decision

Use both approaches strategically:

### Phase 1-2 (Research & Validation): Direct GitHub
- All research findings committed immediately
- Every document has proper commit messages
- No risk of losing work
- Complete automation

### Phase 3+ (Development): Local Filesystem
- Develop and test locally
- Batch commits when features complete
- Human review before pushing
- Better for code development

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Choose the right tool for each phase
- **Automation**: Research phases fully automated
- **Safety**: Development phases allow review
- **Efficiency**: No manual copying in research phases

## Implementation

Starting immediately, all Phase 1 research will be committed directly to GitHub with descriptive commit messages for each finding.
