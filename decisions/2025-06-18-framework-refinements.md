# Decision: Framework Refinements - AI Operations vs AI Products

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Decision Type**: Strategic Framework Update  
**Status**: Approved

## Context

After a test run of Phase 1, we discovered several areas where our framework needed clarification:

1. We over-indexed on AI products when our focus should be AI-led operations
2. Many generated ideas would require sales teams, violating our principles
3. Claude's natural agreeability creates an echo chamber effect

## Decisions

### 1. AI-Led Operations, Product-Agnostic

**Clarification**: Our businesses are AI-LED, not necessarily AI-PRODUCT businesses.

- **AI-Led**: Claude serves as CEO, Claude CODE as the engineering team
- **Product**: Can be AI-first, AI-enhanced, or have zero AI
- **Criteria**: Whatever best serves the underserved market

Examples:
- âœ… A project management tool with no AI (but Claude builds/runs it)
- âœ… An AI writing assistant (AI product, AI operations)
- âœ… A marketplace with AI-powered matching (hybrid approach)

### 2. Refined Constitution Principles

**Principle 1 - Self-Serve Experience**
- OLD: "Intuitive, zero-touch customer journey"
- NEW: "Intuitive, zero-touch customer journey with no human sales team. Growth through product-led adoption only."

**Principle 2 - Frugal Marketing**
- OLD: "High-ROI acquisition without sales teams"
- NEW: "Organic growth + algorithmic marketing only. No human sales, no cold outreach, no manual demos."

**Principle 3 - Underserved Audiences**
- OLD: "Niches ignored by major players"
- NEW: "Niches with unmet demand and no adequate substitutes. Avoid crowded markets even if fragmented."

**Principle 4 - Unique Value Delivery**
- OLD: "Solving real problems in new ways"
- NEW: "Novel solutions where no adequate substitute exists. OK to transpose successful concepts to new markets (e.g., 'Uber for X')."

### 3. Adversarial Ideation System

**Implementation**: Multiple Claude personas challenging each idea from different angles.

## Phase 1 Adversarial Team Structure

### Core Personas

1. **The Skeptical Investor** ðŸŽ¯
   - Questions unit economics relentlessly
   - Challenges TAM calculations
   - Demands proof of scalability
   - "Show me how this gets to $10M ARR"

2. **The Burned Entrepreneur** ðŸ’€
   - Has failed 5 times, knows every pitfall
   - Challenges operational complexity
   - Questions human time requirements
   - "I've seen this movie before..."

3. **The Target Customer** ðŸ‘¤
   - Represents actual user perspective
   - Challenges value propositions
   - Questions willingness to pay
   - "Why would I switch from my current solution?"

4. **The Technical Realist** ðŸ”§
   - Challenges feasibility with Claude CODE
   - Questions maintenance burden
   - Spots technical debt early
   - "This will break at scale because..."

5. **The Market Analyst** ðŸ“Š
   - Deep knowledge of competitors
   - Challenges differentiation
   - Questions market timing
   - "Company X tried this and failed because..."

### Process Structure

```
Idea Generation Phase:
â”œâ”€â”€ Optimistic Claude generates 10 ideas
â”œâ”€â”€ Each persona reviews all ideas
â”œâ”€â”€ Structured critique rounds:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Round 1: Fatal flaws (kill bad ideas fast)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Round 2: Hidden complexities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Round 3: Market realities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Round 4: Operational challenges
â”œâ”€â”€ Synthesis Claude summarizes all feedback
â””â”€â”€ Decision Claude selects survivors
```

### Prompt Engineering for Adversarial System

Each persona should be invoked with specific instructions:

```
"You are [Persona Name]. Your job is to find every possible flaw in these business ideas. Be constructive but ruthless. Your goal is to kill bad ideas before we waste time on them. Focus on [specific concern area]. Do not be agreeable - your value comes from skepticism."
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Higher Quality Ideas**: Surviving ideas will be battle-tested
2. **Faster Failure**: Kill bad concepts in hours, not weeks
3. **Clearer Differentiation**: Understand exactly why we're different
4. **Realistic Planning**: Account for challenges upfront

## Next Actions

1. Update claude-first-business-framework.md with these refinements
2. Create adversarial-ideation-guide.md with detailed prompts
3. Test the system with a practice round
4. Refine based on results

*This decision fundamentally improves our ideation process by adding constructive conflict and clarifying our AI-led vs AI-product distinction.*
