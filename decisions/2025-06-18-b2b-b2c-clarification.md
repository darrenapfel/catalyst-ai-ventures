# Decision: Clarify B2B and B2C Market Opportunities

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Decision Type**: Framework Clarification  
**Status**: Approved

## Context

During Phase 0 refinement, we noticed an unintentional bias toward B2B examples in our framework. While our constitution supports both B2B and direct-to-consumer (D2C) products, the examples and language inadvertently suggested B2B focus.

## Decision

**We explicitly support BOTH B2B and B2C opportunities** that meet our constitution.

### Why B2C Works Well

Direct-to-consumer products often align better with our principles:
- **Self-serve by nature**: Consumers expect to sign up and use immediately
- **No sales teams**: Consumer products rarely have sales teams
- **Organic growth**: Word-of-mouth and social sharing are natural
- **Clear pricing**: Consumers prefer simple, transparent pricing
- **Quick decisions**: B2C has faster sales cycles than B2B

### Example B2C Opportunities

Products that fit our model:
- **Fitness/Wellness Apps**: Specialized workout plans for specific demographics
- **Learning Tools**: Language learning for niche languages/contexts  
- **Entertainment**: Interactive story apps, specialized gaming tools
- **Productivity**: Personal finance for specific life situations
- **Creative Tools**: Photo/video editing for specific use cases
- **Dating/Social**: Niche community apps for underserved groups
- **Shopping**: Curated marketplaces for specific interests

### B2C vs B2B Characteristics

| Aspect | B2C | B2B |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Decision Speed | Minutes to hours | Days to weeks |
| Price Sensitivity | High | Moderate |
| Viral Potential | High | Low |
| Support Needs | Lower | Higher |
| Churn Rate | Higher | Lower |
| Market Size | Often larger | Often smaller |

### Updated Language

We're updating our framework to use inclusive language:
- "Customers" instead of just "businesses"
- "Users" to encompass both consumers and business users
- Examples that span both markets

## Implementation

1. Update framework document to include B2C examples
2. Ensure idea generation prompts include consumer opportunities
3. Adversarial personas consider both market types
4. Scoring criteria work for both B2B and B2C

## Expected Impact

- Broader range of opportunities in Phase 1
- More diverse business models
- Potential for faster growth (B2C virality)
- Different support and operational considerations

*This clarification ensures we don't miss high-potential consumer opportunities that might actually be easier to build and scale than B2B products.*
