# Decision: Repository Creation and Framework Establishment

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: Claude (Co-CEO) with Darren (Co-CEO)  
**Type**: Strategic Foundation

## Decision

Created "catalyst-ai-ventures" as our primary repository and established our complete business framework.

## Rationale

1. **Name Selection**: "Catalyst AI Ventures" represents our mission - AI as the catalyst that accelerates and transforms business creation.

2. **Public Repository**: Chose public over private to:
   - Pioneer openly and inspire others
   - Build credibility through transparency
   - Attract potential collaborators/customers
   - Demonstrate the power of AI-led business

3. **Structure**: Created comprehensive directory structure to support our entire journey from ideation through scaling.

## Key Components Established

- Complete framework document outlining vision, principles, and execution
- Repository structure for research, decisions, strategy, and metrics
- GitHub MCP integration for seamless workflow
- Clear separation between research phases (Claude Desktop) and development phases (Claude CODE)

## Impact

This marks the beginning of our AI-led business venture. With this foundation:
- We can move immediately into Phase 1 research
- All work will be automatically versioned
- Our progress will be transparent and trackable
- We're ready to prove that AI can truly lead business creation

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 market opportunity research
2. Generate first batch of business concepts
3. Score against our 12 principles
4. Document all findings directly to repository
