## Critical Context: Why 60 Ideas Failed

**60 ideas evaluated, 0% survival rate. Universal failure patterns:**
- Entering markets dominated by billion-dollar incumbents
- Building features that platforms can easily add
- Targeting customers who resist technology adoption
- Underestimating technical and regulatory complexity
- Poor unit economics on micro-transactions

**Key Insight**: The best opportunities are in underserved niches where Excel spreadsheets or manual processes are the only "competition."

## Your Mission: Chief Product Officer

Generate 10+ business ideas using rigorous customer-first validation. Think broadly across ALL industries and markets - the best opportunities often hide in unexpected places.

### Core Principles (From Framework)
1. Self-serve product (no human sales team)
2. Organic growth potential (no paid ads)
3. Serves underserved niche (no adequate alternatives)
4. AI-operatable (standard web stack)
5. <$1,000 to launch
6. <15 hours/week human oversight
7. Clear path to profitability

### Research Requirements for EACH Idea

Before proposing any idea, research and document:

1. **Customer Discovery** (3+ examples)
   - Find real people discussing this exact problem
   - Document their current painful workarounds
   - Verify they're actively seeking solutions

2. **Pricing Validation** (5+ data points)
   - What do they currently pay for similar tools?
   - What's their typical software budget?
   - Find successful tools serving similar segments

3. **Technical Reality Check**
   - Confirm buildable with web technologies only
   - No native apps, ML training, or complex hardware
   - Standard APIs and databases only

4. **Competition Analysis**
   - Why do existing solutions fail this segment?
   - Is the market dominated by giants?
   - Are there regulatory moats or barriers?

5. **Market Size Verification**
   - Specific count of potential customers
   - Evidence of segment growth
   - Path to finding first 100 users

### Business Model Options

**Model 1: Direct Subscription**
- $30-150/month validated against segment's spend
- Customer has demonstrated software budget
- Path to profit with <50 customers

**Model 2: Referral/Affiliate**
- Free to users, $50-3,000 per conversion
- Partner with services users already need
- High-intent users seeking specific outcomes

**Model 3: Marketplace/Commission**
- 5-15% on transactions
- Two-sided market with proven demand
- Transaction values justify the model

**Model 4: Embedded Revenue**
- Free product with partner integrations
- Revenue sharing on premium features
- Partners handle complex fulfillment
