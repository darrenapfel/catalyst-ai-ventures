# Portfolio Pipeline Status

**Last Updated**: June 19, 2025  
**Evaluation System**: Interactive Two-Phase Adversarial  
**Target Survival Rate**: <10% (ruthless quality filtering)

## Phase 1: Idea Generation & Filtering

### Current Status
- **Total Ideas Evaluated**: 23 (from 2 proposal batches)
- **Total Survivors**: 0 (0% survival rate) ✅ **TARGET ACHIEVED**
- **Borderline Pivots Identified**: 3 (CogniEase, ElderConnect, CaregiverCompass)
- **Ready for Phase 2 Validation**: 0 (awaiting pivot development)

### Evaluation System Performance
- **System**: Interactive Two-Phase Adversarial Evaluation
- **Quality Standard**: <10% survival rate target
- **Process**: Claude role-plays 5 adversarial personas for authentic criticism
- **Command**: `python tools/adversarial_conversation_interactive.py proposal.md`

### Expected Pipeline Flow
```
100 Ideas Generated → ~10 Survive Phase 1 → ~3 Pass Phase 2 → ~1 Launches
```

## Phase 2: Deep Validation (Not Started)
**Purpose**: Rigorous market research on Phase 1 survivors
**Activities**:
- Total Addressable Market (TAM) calculations
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Technical feasibility deep-dive
- Go-to-market strategy development
- Customer interview validation

## Phase 3: Build & Launch (Not Started)
**Purpose**: Develop and launch validated businesses
**Activities**:
- Technical implementation with Claude CODE
- MVP development and testing
- Launch and early customer acquisition
- Growth optimization and scaling

## Success Patterns (To Be Identified)

**Idea Characteristics That Survive**:
- TBD (no survivors yet to analyze patterns)

**Common Kill Reasons** (from 23 evaluations):
- Customer segment/pricing mismatches (18/23 ideas)
- Technical unfeasibility/AI capability overestimation (15/23 ideas) 
- Legal/medical liability risks without proper oversight (12/23 ideas)
- Platform dependency vulnerabilities (10/23 ideas)
- Feature-not-product syndrome (8/23 ideas)
- Markets too small for venture scale (7/23 ideas)

**Market Performance** (from 23 evaluations):
- B2B vs B2C survival rates: 0% both (12 B2B, 8 B2C, 3 hybrid all failed)
- Price point patterns: Premium pricing ($50-300/month) failed consistently in price-sensitive segments
- Technical feasibility patterns: AI capability overestimation in 65% of proposals
- Customer segment failures: Seniors, students, nonprofits, freelancers proved unsuitable for premium pricing

## Portfolio Strategy

**Catalyst AI Ventures = Portfolio Company**
- Generate hundreds of ideas through repeated evaluation cycles
- Maintain rigorous quality standards with <10% survival rates
- Build portfolio of 3-5 AI-led businesses over 12-18 months
- Each business: <$1K launch cost, <15hrs/week operation, profitable within 8 weeks

## Evaluation Quality Metrics

### Target Standards
- **Survival Rate**: <10% (vs 70% with old programmatic system)
- **Evaluation Rigor**: All 5 personas engage authentically
- **Pivot Success**: Borderline ideas improved through constructive criticism
- **False Positives**: Minimize weak ideas passing to expensive Phase 2

### System Benefits
- **Cost Avoidance**: Kill weak ideas before expensive validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Only strong concepts advance
- **Learning Acceleration**: Pattern recognition across evaluations
- **Scale Efficiency**: Handle 100+ evaluations systematically

## Next Milestones

1. **First Evaluation Batch**: Process 10+ ideas from Claude.ai Research
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify success/failure patterns after 50+ evaluations  
3. **System Optimization**: Refine personas based on evaluation learnings
4. **Phase 2 Transition**: Begin deep validation on first survivors

## Session Log

### Session 4 - June 19, 2025
- **Achievement**: Completed first large-scale adversarial evaluation of 23 business ideas
- **Results**: 0% survival rate (target <10% achieved), 3 borderline pivots identified
- **Learning**: Customer segment validation and technical feasibility assessment need major improvement
- **Framework Update**: Added alternative monetization models (referral, marketplace, partner revenue) to expand viable opportunities beyond subscription-only
- **Status**: Phase 1 system validated, patterns identified, framework enhanced for improved ideation

### Session 3 - June 18, 2025
- **Achievement**: Implemented interactive two-phase adversarial evaluation system
- **System**: Ready for scale evaluation (100+ ideas)
- **Status**: Phase 1 evaluation system complete, awaiting first proposal batch

### Session 2 - June 18, 2025  
- **Achievement**: Defined adversarial persona system and hybrid approach
- **Learning**: Programmatic scoring too lenient (70% survival vs <10% target)

### Session 1 - June 18, 2025
- **Achievement**: Established repository structure and framework
- **Discovery**: GitHub MCP integration for direct commits
