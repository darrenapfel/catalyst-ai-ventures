# Portfolio Pipeline Status

**Last Updated**: June 18, 2025  
**Evaluation System**: Interactive Two-Phase Adversarial  
**Target Survival Rate**: <10% (ruthless quality filtering)

## Phase 1: Idea Generation & Filtering

### Current Status
- **Total Ideas Evaluated**: 0
- **Total Survivors**: 0 (0% survival rate)
- **Ready for Phase 2 Validation**: 0

### Evaluation System Performance
- **System**: Interactive Two-Phase Adversarial Evaluation
- **Quality Standard**: <10% survival rate target
- **Process**: Claude role-plays 5 adversarial personas for authentic criticism
- **Command**: `python tools/adversarial_conversation_interactive.py proposal.md`

### Expected Pipeline Flow
```
100 Ideas Generated → ~10 Survive Phase 1 → ~3 Pass Phase 2 → ~1 Launches
```

## Phase 2: Deep Validation (Not Started)
**Purpose**: Rigorous market research on Phase 1 survivors
**Activities**:
- Total Addressable Market (TAM) calculations
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Technical feasibility deep-dive
- Go-to-market strategy development
- Customer interview validation

## Phase 3: Build & Launch (Not Started)
**Purpose**: Develop and launch validated businesses
**Activities**:
- Technical implementation with Claude CODE
- MVP development and testing
- Launch and early customer acquisition
- Growth optimization and scaling

## Success Patterns (To Be Identified)

**Idea Characteristics That Survive**:
- TBD (will track patterns as evaluations accumulate)

**Common Kill Reasons**:
- TBD (will identify failure patterns)

**Market Performance**:
- B2B vs B2C survival rates: TBD
- Price point optimization: TBD
- Technical feasibility patterns: TBD

## Portfolio Strategy

**Catalyst AI Ventures = Portfolio Company**
- Generate hundreds of ideas through repeated evaluation cycles
- Maintain rigorous quality standards with <10% survival rates
- Build portfolio of 3-5 AI-led businesses over 12-18 months
- Each business: <$1K launch cost, <15hrs/week operation, profitable within 8 weeks

## Evaluation Quality Metrics

### Target Standards
- **Survival Rate**: <10% (vs 70% with old programmatic system)
- **Evaluation Rigor**: All 5 personas engage authentically
- **Pivot Success**: Borderline ideas improved through constructive criticism
- **False Positives**: Minimize weak ideas passing to expensive Phase 2

### System Benefits
- **Cost Avoidance**: Kill weak ideas before expensive validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Only strong concepts advance
- **Learning Acceleration**: Pattern recognition across evaluations
- **Scale Efficiency**: Handle 100+ evaluations systematically

## Next Milestones

1. **First Evaluation Batch**: Process 10+ ideas from Claude.ai Research
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify success/failure patterns after 50+ evaluations  
3. **System Optimization**: Refine personas based on evaluation learnings
4. **Phase 2 Transition**: Begin deep validation on first survivors
