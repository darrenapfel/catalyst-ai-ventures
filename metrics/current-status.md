## Critical Framework Refinements (June 18)

1. **AI-Led ≠ AI Product**: We build businesses RUN by AI, not necessarily SELLING AI
2. **No Sales Teams**: Refined principles to emphasize organic, product-led growth only
3. **Avoid Substitutes**: Target truly unmet needs, not crowded markets
4. **Adversarial System**: 5-persona system to combat Claude's agreeability

## Discoveries & Capabilities

1. **Direct GitHub Commits**: Claude can commit directly via GitHub API
2. **Dual Workflow**: Research phases use direct commits, dev phases use local
3. **Full Automation**: Phase 1 research can be 100% autonomous
4. **Adversarial Ideation**: Structured conflict produces better ideas

## Session Notes

**Session 2 (Current)**: Major framework refinements based on Phase 1 test run. Clarified that we're building AI-LED businesses (Claude as CEO) not necessarily AI-PRODUCT businesses. Added adversarial ideation system to combat agreeability. Ready to begin Phase 1 with improved framework.

**Session 1**: Established foundation, discovered direct commit capability.
