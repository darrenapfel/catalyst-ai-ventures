# Catalyst AI Ventures - Current Status

**Last Updated**: June 19, 2025
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Opportunity Discovery 🚀

## Quick Summary
- **Ideas Evaluated**: 60 (across 4 proposal batches)
- **Survivors**: 0 (0% survival rate - meeting <10% target ✅)
- **Key Learning**: All ideas entering dominated markets with weak differentiation
- **Next Action**: Generate ideas for underserved niches with no adequate solutions

## Phase Progress

### ✅ Phase 0: Setup & Framework (COMPLETE)
- Repository structure established
- Framework and constitution documented
- Evaluation process refined (manual > automated)
- Tools and workflows clarified

### 🚀 Phase 1: Opportunity Discovery (IN PROGRESS)
- **Completed**: 60 ideas evaluated with brutal adversarial process
- **Success**: Achieved <10% survival rate (actually 0%)
- **Challenge**: CPO consistently generates ideas for saturated markets
- **Focus**: Need ideas that avoid Zillow, Procore, LegalZoom, etc.

### 🔮 Phase 2: Validation (NOT STARTED)
- Awaiting first survivors from Phase 1
- Will conduct deep market research
- Customer validation interviews
- Technical feasibility assessment

### 🏗️ Phase 3: Build & Launch (NOT STARTED)
- Will use Claude CODE for development
- Target: MVP in 7-8 weeks
- Budget: <$1,000 to launch

## Key Patterns from 60 Evaluations

### Fatal Flaws (Why Ideas Failed)
1. **Market Saturation** (92% of ideas): Entering markets with 10+ established competitors
2. **Feature Not Product** (67%): Building features that platforms/competitors already offer
3. **Tech-Averse Customers** (58%): Targeting contractors, lawyers, accountants who resist change
4. **Technical Complexity** (67%): Underestimating integration and compliance requirements
5. **Unit Economics** (28%): Impossible economics (e.g., $10 commission on micro-transactions)

### Industries to Avoid
- Construction tech (Procore dominates)
- Legal tech (Clio ecosystem)
- Real estate (Zillow's territory)
- Student loans (terrible timing)
- Generic e-commerce tools (race to bottom)

## Current Tools & Processes

### ✅ Active
1. **Manual Adversarial Evaluation** - Claude role-plays 5 brutal personas
2. **Evaluation Dashboard** - View results at `localhost:3000`
3. **Tracking Files** - Master tracker JSON and portfolio pipeline

### ❌ Deprecated
- Python automation scripts (see `tools/DEPRECATED.md`)
- Any attempt to "automate Claude"

## Next Actions
1. Use `ideation-bootloader-v3.md` with multiple LLMs (Opus, GPT, Gemini)
2. Generate diverse proposals across ALL industries
3. Focus on: 
   - Underserved niches with no solutions
   - Markets where Excel is the competitor
   - Clear 10x improvements
   - Technical feasibility within our constraints
4. See `docs/processes/multi-llm-ideation-guide.md` for process

## Repository Health
- **Documentation**: Consolidated and rationalized ✅
- **Single Entry Point**: `catalyst-bootloader.md` ✅
- **Deprecated Files**: Clearly marked ✅
- **Git Status**: All changes committed ✅
