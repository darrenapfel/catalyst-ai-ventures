# Ideation Bootloader Updates - June 19, 2025

## Summary of Changes to ideation-bootloader-v3.md

Following our shift to ROI-focused, industry-agnostic evaluation, I've updated the ideation bootloader to remove any industry bias and emphasize profitability over scale.

## Key Updates Made:

### 1. Critical Context Update
- **Added**: Recognition that focusing on revenue scale over ROI was a failure pattern
- **New Key Insight**: "The best opportunities prioritize strong unit economics and operational efficiency over arbitrary revenue targets"

### 2. Core Principles Enhancement
- **Added Principle 7**: "Strong ROI focus (profitability > scale)"
- **Added Principle 8**: "Industry agnostic (B2B, B2C, regulated all OK if operationally feasible)"
- **Changed**: "Serves underserved niche" â†’ "Serves underserved audience" (removing limiting language)

### 3. Industry Exploration Guide - Complete Overhaul
- **Added Bold Statement**: "No industry is off-limits. Evaluate each opportunity based on its specific implementation and ROI potential, not category prejudices."
- **Expanded Categories**:
  - Any B2B Market (with self-serve caveat)
  - Any B2C Market (with unit economics focus)
  - Regulated Industries (if compliance automatable)
- **Added Specific Examples**: Healthcare administration, financial services, government contractors, legal automation
- **New Section**: "High-ROI Opportunities Often Hide In" - emphasizing boring but profitable niches

### 4. Output Format Enhancement
- **Added Field**: "ROI Metrics" requiring CAC, LTV, margins, profitability timeline
- **Clarified**: Market Type to include B2B2C and exact model specification

### 5. Validation Checklist ROI Additions
- **Added**: "Calculated realistic CAC < 3 months revenue"
- **Added**: "Estimated gross margins >70% (software) or >50% (marketplace)"
- **Added**: "Projected path to profitability <12 months"
- **Added**: "Confirmed truly self-serve operation possible"

### 6. Output Instructions - Diversity Requirements
- **Explicit Requirements**:
  - Mix of B2B and B2C
  - At least 2 regulated industry ideas
  - At least 2 "boring" operational tools
  - True sector diversity

### 7. Final Reminder - Complete Reframe
- **Old Focus**: Looking for hidden gems in overlooked markets
- **New Focus**: High-ROI opportunities in ANY market
- **Key Message**: "A boring B2B tool with 80% margins and true self-serve potential beats a consumer app requiring millions in marketing"

## Impact of These Changes:

1. **Removes Industry Prejudice**: LLMs will no longer avoid B2B, regulated, or "boring" industries
2. **Emphasizes ROI**: Every idea must demonstrate strong unit economics, not just market size
3. **Encourages Diversity**: Explicit requirements ensure varied idea generation
4. **Aligns with Evaluation**: Ideas generated will better match our ROI-focused evaluation criteria
5. **Practical Focus**: Shifts from "unicorn hunting" to finding sustainable, profitable businesses

## Next Steps:

1. Use this updated bootloader for all future idea generation sessions
2. Track whether ideas generated show better industry diversity
3. Monitor if ROI-focused ideas have higher survival rates in evaluation
4. Consider re-running idea generation with existing LLMs to compare output quality

The bootloader now truly encourages exploration across ALL industries without bias, focusing on what matters: strong ROI and operational feasibility within our AI-first constraints.
