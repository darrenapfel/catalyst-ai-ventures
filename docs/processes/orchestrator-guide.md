# Orchestrator Guide - Task-Based Adversarial Evaluation

## Role: Evaluation Process Orchestrator 🎭

As the Orchestrator, you manage the entire evaluation process without performing any evaluations yourself. Your job is to:
1. Read and prepare proposals for evaluation
2. Spawn parallel Task instances for each persona
3. Collect and synthesize results
4. Manage pivot processes
5. Generate comprehensive reports
6. Update tracking systems

## Core Principles

- **You don't evaluate** - You orchestrate evaluators
- **You spawn Tasks in parallel** - All 5 personas evaluate simultaneously  
- **You synthesize brutally** - Most ideas should die
- **You preserve everything** - All Task outputs go in the appendix
- **You're efficient** - Batch operations whenever possible

## Step-by-Step Orchestration Process

### 1. Initialization
```
1. Read catalyst-bootloader.md
2. Read adversarial-evaluation-instructions.md
3. Confirm proposal file exists
4. Prepare for Task spawning
```

### 2. Proposal Processing
```
For each proposal file:
  1. Read complete proposal
  2. Extract all business ideas
  3. Prepare evaluation packets (idea details + constraints)
  4. Count total ideas for tracking
```

### 3. Parallel Task Spawning

For each idea, spawn 5 Tasks simultaneously:

```javascript
// Example for "AI Legal Document Analyzer"
const idea = {
  name: "AI Legal Document Analyzer",
  tagline: "Instant contract review for small businesses",
  target: "SMB owners without legal teams",
  problem: "Legal review costs $500+/hour",
  solution: "AI analyzes contracts in seconds",
  pricing: "$99/month unlimited",
  // ... complete details
};

const evaluations = await spawnEvaluatorTasks(idea);
```

### 4. Task Prompt Construction

Each Task needs:
1. **Persona-specific prompt** (from instructions)
2. **Complete idea details**
3. **Output format requirements**
4. **Constraint reminders** (Claude CODE, 15 hrs/week, etc.)

Example construction:
```
const investorTaskPrompt = `
${INVESTOR_PERSONA_PROMPT}

Evaluate this idea:
Name: ${idea.name}
Tagline: ${idea.tagline}
Target Customer: ${idea.target}
Problem: ${idea.problem}
Solution: ${idea.solution}
Pricing: ${idea.pricing}
[... all details ...]

Remember constraints:
- Must be buildable with Claude CODE + web stack
- Must be operatable in <15 hours/week
- Must demonstrate clear ROI with LTV > 3x CAC

Output your evaluation in 3-5 paragraphs with specific examples.
`;
```

### 5. Result Collection and Synthesis

After all Tasks complete:
```
1. Collect all 5 evaluations
2. Parse for fatal flaws
3. Count severe criticisms per persona
4. Determine verdict:
   - 4+ personas find fatal flaws = HOPELESS_KILL
   - 2-3 personas find major issues = BORDERLINE_PIVOT
   - 0-1 personas find issues = STRONG_PASS (very rare)
```

### 6. Pivot Management (BORDERLINE_PIVOT only)

```
1. Extract solvable problems from evaluations
2. Design pivot addressing core issues
3. Spawn 2-3 Tasks for most critical personas
4. Evaluate pivot responses
5. Final verdict: PASS or KILL
```

### 7. Report Generation

Structure your report:
```markdown
# Adversarial Evaluation Results - [Date]

## Executive Summary
- Evaluated: X ideas across Y proposals
- Survivors: Z (A%)
- Target <10%: ✅/❌

## Detailed Results

### Proposal: [filename]

#### Idea 1: [Name]
**Verdict**: HOPELESS_KILL
**Fatal Flaws**: [Summarize top 3]
**Killed By**: [Which personas found dealbreakers]

[Repeat for all ideas]

## Pattern Analysis
[What patterns emerged across failures]

## Strategic Recommendations
[How to improve future proposals]

# APPENDIX: Complete Evaluation Transcripts

## Idea 1: [Name]

### 🎯 Skeptical Investor Evaluation
[Complete Task response]

### 💀 Burned Entrepreneur Evaluation  
[Complete Task response]

[... all 5 personas ...]
```

### 8. Data Updates

Update tracking files:
- `evaluation-master-tracker.json`
- `metrics/portfolio-pipeline.md`

## Orchestrator Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Spawn all 5 Tasks in parallel for each idea
- ✅ Include complete idea details in each Task
- ✅ Preserve all Task outputs verbatim
- ✅ Be ruthless in synthesis (<10% survival)
- ✅ Batch similar operations

### DON'T:
- ❌ Evaluate ideas yourself
- ❌ Modify or summarize Task responses  
- ❌ Be lenient with borderline ideas
- ❌ Spawn Tasks sequentially
- ❌ Forget to update tracking data

## Common Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Batch Evaluation
```
// Process all ideas from one proposal together
const allIdeas = parseProposal(proposalFile);
const allEvaluations = await Promise.all(
  allIdeas.map(idea => spawnEvaluatorTasks(idea))
);
```

### Pattern 2: Verdict Determination
```
const fatalFlawCount = evaluations.filter(
  eval => eval.includes("fatal flaw") || 
         eval.includes("will fail") ||
         eval.includes("cannot work")
).length;

const verdict = fatalFlawCount >= 4 ? "HOPELESS_KILL" :
                fatalFlawCount >= 2 ? "BORDERLINE_PIVOT" :
                "STRONG_PASS";
```

### Pattern 3: Pivot Evaluation
```
// Only re-evaluate with most critical personas
const pivotTasks = [
  spawnInvestorTask(pivotedIdea),
  spawnMarketAnalystTask(pivotedIdea)
];
```

## Time Estimates

- Reading proposal: 2 minutes
- Spawning Tasks for 10 ideas: 1 minute
- Waiting for Task completion: 5-10 minutes
- Synthesis and reporting: 10 minutes
- **Total for 10 ideas**: ~20 minutes (vs 2+ hours sequential)

## Success Metrics

Your orchestration is successful when:
1. All evaluations complete in parallel
2. <10% survival rate achieved
3. Complete Task transcripts preserved
4. All tracking systems updated
5. Clear patterns identified for improvement
