*Expanding beyond subscription-only to unlock new opportunities*

## Purpose
Enable viable businesses that serve free users while generating revenue through alternative models that align with our AI-led operations constraints.

## Core Principle
**Free to end user + automated monetization = expanded market opportunities**

## Approved Alternative Models

### 1. Referral/Lead Generation (High Potential) 🏆

**Ideal Verticals**:

### 2. Marketplace Commissions (Medium Potential) ⚡
**Examples**: Airbnb, Etsy, Upwork, TaskRabbit
**Model**: Platform connecting buyers/sellers, taking percentage of transactions
**Revenue**: 3-15% of transaction value

### 3. Advertising Revenue (Lower Potential) 📊
**Examples**: Google, Meta, Pinterest, Reddit
**Model**: Free content/tools supported by targeted advertising
**Revenue**: $0.50-$10 per 1,000 impressions (CPM)

**Why It's Challenging for Us**:
⚠️ Requires massive scale (millions of users)
⚠️ Privacy concerns with tracking
⚠️ Ad optimization complexity
⚠️ Revenue unpredictability

**Only Consider If**:

### 4. Data/Insights Sales (Medium Potential) 📈
**Examples**: Glassdoor, Indeed, public market data

✅ High margins on insight products

**Requirements**:
- Large dataset of user interactions
- Business customers who value insights
- Privacy compliance (anonymization)
- Insight packaging and delivery

### 5. Premium Partner Integration (High Potential) 🔗
**Examples**: Mint (credit card offers), Expedia (hotel bookings)
**Model**: Free core product + revenue from premium partner services
**Revenue**: Revenue sharing or flat fees for integrations

**Why It's Ideal**:
✅ Core product remains free
✅ Revenue from qualified user actions
✅ Partners handle complex fulfillment
✅ AI optimizes user-partner matching

**Examples**:
- Travel planning → hotel/flight booking commissions

## Implementation in Ideation

**New Output Format Addition**:
