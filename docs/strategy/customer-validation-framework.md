# Customer Validation Framework
*Created after 0% survival rate in adversarial evaluation*

## Purpose
Prevent systematic customer segment/pricing mismatches that killed all 23 evaluated ideas.

## The Core Problem

**What Failed**: Assuming customer segments would pay based on value proposition alone
**What Works**: Proving customer segments already pay similar amounts for similar tools

## Mandatory Customer Evidence Requirements

### 1. Pain Point Validation
**Requirement**: Find 3+ specific examples of target customers actively seeking solutions

**Evidence Format**:
```
- Reddit r/[community]: "[exact quote about problem]" - [engagement metrics]
- LinkedIn [group]: "[quote about current solution failure]" - [comments/reactions]  
- Forum [specific]: "[quote about willingness to pay for solution]"
- Industry publication: "[article/survey showing problem prevalence]"
```

**Minimum Bar**: Direct quotes from target customers describing the specific problem your solution addresses

### 2. Pricing Reality Validation
**Requirement**: Prove target segment pays similar amounts for comparable tools

**Research Process**:
1. Identify 5+ tools the target segment currently uses
2. Document actual pricing (not list prices - what they actually pay)
3. Confirm through reviews, case studies, or direct evidence
4. Map pricing to customer segment income/budget

**Evidence Format**:
```
Target Segment Pricing Analysis:
- Tool 1: $X/month - [customer reviews showing adoption]
- Tool 2: $Y/month - [case studies with similar companies]
- Tool 3: $Z/month - [public pricing with customer testimonials]
Average Range: $A-B/month
Our Pricing: $C/month (within validated range)
```

### 3. Customer Segment Income Validation
**Requirement**: Confirm target segment has sufficient income/budget for pricing model

**Validation Questions**:
- Individual B2C: What's their disposable income? Software spending habits?
- Small Business B2B: What's their annual revenue? Software budget allocation?
- Enterprise B2B: Who controls purchasing? What's typical software spend?

**Red Flag Segments** (avoid unless exceptional evidence):
- Students (limited disposable income)
- Seniors on fixed income (price-sensitive)
- Nonprofits (expect discounts/free)
- Individual freelancers under $50K (high price sensitivity)
- Healthcare workers (don't control purchasing)

**Proven Segments**:
- Profitable businesses $100K+ revenue
- Professional services with software budgets
- SaaS companies (understand software value)
- Affluent professionals with expense accounts

### 4. Market Size Validation
**Requirement**: Count actual businesses/individuals in target segment

**Research Process**:
1. Use specific data sources (Bureau of Labor Statistics, industry reports, trade associations)
2. Count addressable market size with geographic constraints
3. Apply filters for income/budget requirements
4. Document growth trends with evidence

**Evidence Format**:
```
Market Size Validation:
- Total segment size: [number] based on [data source]
- Income/budget qualified: [number] based on [criteria]
- Geographic focus: [region] = [number] potential customers
- Growth trend: [X%] annually based on [source]
- Minimum viable market: [number] (we need ~50 customers)
```

### 5. Technical Feasibility Validation
**Requirement**: Confirm solution is buildable with standard web stack

**Technical Constraints**:
✅ **BUILDABLE**: Web apps, databases, API integrations, content generation, basic automation
❌ **NOT BUILDABLE**: Native mobile apps, real-time video/audio, ML training, voice recognition, AR/VR

**Validation Process**:
1. Map solution features to technical components
2. Identify required APIs and their costs
3. Estimate development complexity (weeks, not months)
4. Confirm no specialized expertise required

### 6. Competition Gap Validation
**Requirement**: Specific reasons why existing solutions fail target segment

**Research Process**:
1. Identify 3-5 closest existing solutions
2. Research customer complaints about these solutions
3. Map gaps to your solution's differentiators
4. Confirm gaps are meaningful to customers (not just features)

**Evidence Format**:
```
Competition Analysis:
- Competitor 1: [Tool] - Customer complaints: "[specific pain points]"
- Competitor 2: [Tool] - Gap: "[what it doesn't do for our segment]"
- Competitor 3: [Tool] - Pricing issue: "[too expensive/cheap for segment]"
Our Advantage: [specific differentiation based on real customer needs]
```

## Customer Validation Scoring

**Pass Criteria** (all must be met):
- [ ] 3+ specific customer pain point examples with quotes
- [ ] 5+ comparable tools with pricing evidence
- [ ] Customer segment income/budget validation
- [ ] Minimum 10,000 addressable customers with data source
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Specific competition gaps identified

**Auto-Reject Triggers**:
- Generic customer descriptions ("small businesses")
- No pricing comparable evidence
- Customer segments with known price sensitivity
- Technical requirements beyond web stack
- "No competition" claims (usually means no market)

## Implementation in Ideation

**Before proposing any idea**:
1. Complete customer validation research first
2. Document all evidence in proposal
3. Include direct quotes and data sources
4. Map pricing to customer segment reality
5. Confirm technical buildability

**Proposal Quality Gate**:
Every idea must include "Customer Validation Evidence" section with specific research findings before proceeding to adversarial evaluation.

## Success Metrics

**Target**: 10%+ survival rate in adversarial evaluation (vs 0% previously)
**Method**: Evidence-based customer validation prevents systematic mismatches
**Quality**: Better to propose 5 well-validated ideas than 15 unvalidated ones
