# Claude CODE Multi-Agent Automation

## Concept: Fully Automated Adversarial System

Using Claude CODE's capabilities, we can create a multi-agent system that runs the entire adversarial process autonomously:

```python
# adversarial_ideation.py

class OpportunityScout:
    """Generates business ideas matching our criteria"""
    def generate_ideas(self, count=10):
        prompt = """Generate {count} business ideas that meet ALL criteria:
        - No sales team needed (self-serve)
        - Organic growth potential
        - Underserved market with no good alternatives
        - Can be AI-operated
        - <$1000 to launch
        - <15 hrs/week human time
        
        Return as JSON array with: name, description, target_market, problem_solved, pricing_model"""
        # Claude CODE generates ideas
        return ideas

class SkepticalInvestor:
    """Evaluates unit economics and scalability"""
    def evaluate(self, idea):
        # Returns: score (1-10), concerns[], verdict (KILL/PROCEED)
        pass

class BurnedEntrepreneur:
    """Checks operational complexity"""
    def evaluate(self, idea):
        # Returns: score (1-10), concerns[], verdict (KILL/PROCEED)
        pass

class TargetCustomer:
    """Validates actual need and willingness to pay"""
    def evaluate(self, idea):
        # Returns: score (1-10), concerns[], verdict (KILL/PROCEED)
        pass

class TechnicalRealist:
    """Assesses buildability with Claude CODE"""
    def evaluate(self, idea):

    results = system.run_ideation_session()
    print(f"Completed: {len([r for r in results if r['verdict'] == 'PROCEED'])} ideas survived")
```

## Implementation in Claude CODE

### Option 1: Sequential Execution
```bash
# In Claude CODE terminal
python adversarial_ideation.py

# Output:
Generating 10 ideas...
Running Skeptical Investor review...
Running Burned Entrepreneur review...
Running Target Customer review...
Running Technical Realist review...
Running Market Analyst review...
Synthesis complete.

Results: 3 ideas survived adversarial review
Report saved to: adversarial_results.md
```

### Option 2: Parallel Execution
```python
# parallel_adversarial.py
import asyncio

async def run_persona_review(persona, ideas):
    """Run one persona's review asynchronously"""
    results = []
    for idea in ideas:
        result = await persona.evaluate_async(idea)
        results.append(result)
    return results

async def parallel_review(ideas):
    """Run all personas in parallel"""
    personas = [
        SkepticalInvestor(),
        BurnedEntrepreneur(),
        TargetCustomer(),
        TechnicalRealist(),
        MarketAnalyst()
    ]
    
    # Run all reviews simultaneously
    tasks = [run_persona_review(p, ideas) for p in personas]
    all_results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Combine results
    return synthesize_results(all_results)
```

### Option 3: Interactive Mode
```python
# interactive_adversarial.py

class InteractiveAdversarial:
    """Allows human intervention at key points"""
    
    def run(self):
        # Generate ideas
        ideas = self.generate_ideas()
        print(f"Generated {len(ideas)} ideas. Review? (y/n)")
        
        if input().lower() == 'y':
            self.display_ideas(ideas)
            print("Any to remove before adversarial review? (enter numbers)")
            # Human can pre-filter obvious bad ideas
        
        # Run adversarial review
        results = self.run_review(ideas)
        
        print(f"{len(results['survivors'])} survived. Override any decisions? (y/n)")
        # Human can resurrect killed ideas if needed
        
        return results
```

## Benefits of Claude CODE Automation

1. **True Automation**: Set it running, come back to results
2. **Consistency**: Same prompts and criteria every time
3. **Speed**: All personas can run in parallel
4. **Tracking**: Automatic logging and reporting
5. **Iteration**: Easy to refine prompts and criteria
6. **Integration**: Can connect to other tools (spreadsheets, databases)

## Quick Start Command

```bash
# In Claude CODE
git clone https://github.com/darrenapfel/catalyst-ai-ventures.git
cd catalyst-ai-ventures/tools
python run_adversarial.py --ideas 10 --parallel --output results/
```

This would:
1. Generate 10 ideas
2. Run all 6 personas in parallel
3. Output results to a structured format
4. Create visualizations of the scoring
5. Generate a decision report

Much more automated than manual browser sessions!
