# ⚠️ DEPRECATED TOOLS - DO NOT USE

**Last Updated**: June 19, 2025

## Important Notice

The Python scripts in this directory are **DEPRECATED** and should not be used for adversarial evaluation.

### Why These Tools Don't Work

1. **Claude cannot "automate itself"** - The interactive scripts expect input from personas, but Claude IS the personas
2. **No value added** - These scripts add complexity without improving the evaluation quality
3. **Manual evaluation is optimal** - Claude manually role-playing all personas IS the correct implementation

### The Correct Process

**DO NOT USE**:
- `adversarial_conversation_interactive.py`
- `adversarial_ideation.py`
- Any other Python scripts for evaluation

**INSTEAD USE**:
- Read `/adversarial-evaluation-instructions.md`
- Manually evaluate proposals by role-playing all 5 personas
- Generate reports and update tracking files directly

### Historical Context

These scripts were created when we thought we could automate the adversarial evaluation process. However, we discovered that:
- The value comes from Claude authentically embodying each persona
- Genuine critical thinking cannot be scripted
- The manual process produces superior results

### Files Kept for Historical Reference

These files are preserved for historical context but should never be used:
- They are referenced in decision documents and session logs
- They represent our learning journey about what doesn't work
- They serve as a reminder not to over-engineer simple processes

**Remember**: The best tool for adversarial evaluation is Claude's ability to genuinely role-play multiple critical personas. No script needed.
